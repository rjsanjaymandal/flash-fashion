          <h2>Conscious Crafting</h2>
          <p>
            We are committed to reducing our environmental footprint at every
            stage of production. From sourcing organic cotton to using
            low-impact dyes, we ensure that our pieces are as kind to the planet
            as they are to you.

          <h2>Ethical Production</h2>
          <p>
            We partner with small-scale manufacturers in India who provide fair
            wages and safe working conditions. We believe that the people behind
            your clothes deserve respect and a living wage. Our factories are
            audited regularly to ensure high standards of safety and ethics.
          </p>

          <h2>Zero-Waste Packaging</h2>
          <p>
            Say goodbye to single-use plastics. Our packaging is 100%
            biodegradable or recyclable. We use cornstarch-based mailers and
            recycled paper cards to ensure your order arrives safely without
            harming the environment.

            fashion.&quot;

          <p>
            By 2026, we aim to transition to 100% recycled materials across our
            entire core collection. We are continuously researching new textile
            innovations like mushroom leather and pineapple silk to lead the way
            in sustainable inclusive fashion.
