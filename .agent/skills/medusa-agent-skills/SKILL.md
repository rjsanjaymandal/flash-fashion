## Installation with Claude Code

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed
- A Medusa project (or planning to create one)

### Install Plugin

1. Start Claude:

```bash
claude
```

2. Add Medusa marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-agent-skills
```

3. Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install medusa-dev@medusa
```

4. Verify the plugin is loaded:

```bash
/plugin
```

You should see the Medusa plugin listed under the Installed tab.

## Installation for Other AI Agents

For other AI agents like Cursor, you can use the [skills](https://skills.sh/) command to install the plugin's skills based on your AI agent:

```bash
npx skills add medusajs/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skill:
# - learning-medusa
```

## Use Plugin

In your Medusa application, ask Claude to build features. Claude will know what to load from the Medusa plugin to build your feature.

### Example Use Cases

Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to build:

**Example 1: Full-stack Feature with Admin UI**

> Implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard

**Example 2: Backend API Development**

> Create a wishlist feature where customers can save products. I need API routes for adding/removing items and retrieving the wishlist.

**Example 3: Admin Dashboard Widget**

> Add a widget to the product detail page in the admin that allows managing related products. Admin users should be able to select which products are related using a searchable table.

**Example 5: Storefront Integration**

> Help me integrate the custom reviews API into my Next.js storefront. Show product reviews on the product detail page with pagination.

## Skills Included

1. **building-with-medusa** - Backend development (modules, workflows, API routes)
2. **building-admin-dashboard-customizations** - Admin UI development (widgets, pages, forms)
3. **building-storefronts** - Storefront integration (SDK usage, React Query patterns)

## Commands Included

1. `/medusa-dev:db-migrate`: Run migrations in your Medusa project.
2. `/medusa-dev:db-generate <module-name>`: Generate migrations for a module.
3. `/medusa-dev:new-user <email> <password>`: Create an admin user.
